Task Orchestrator
=======================
The RMF2 Task Orchestrator is a C++ application that manages behavior trees for RMF task orchestration using 
the BehaviorTree.CPP library. It handles complex behaviors modularly and flexibly through templated action nodes.

**Features**

- BehaviorTree.CPP Integration:

    Provides a robust framework for structured and modular task orchestration, enabling intuitive management of hierarchical behaviors and extensible logic.

- Asynchronous Processing Execution:

    Enhances responsiveness and ensures non-blocking operations through parallel execution of behavior trees.

- AMQP Interface:
    
    Implements a messaging endpoint for seamless communication and task orchestration in distributed systems.

- HTTP Interface:
    
    Provides an HTTP-based endpoint to support integration with web services and external clients.

- Dynamic Configuration:
    
    Enables runtime creation and modification of behavior trees, ensuring adaptability to evolving operational requirements.

- Templated Action Nodes:
    
    Facilitates modular, reusable, and type-safe configurations, simplifying the creation and execution of diverse RMF tasks.

**Applications**

- Robotic Task Orchestration: Ideal for managing multi-robot workflows, enabling dynamic coordination and task execution across distributed robotic systems.
- Workflow Automation: Can be applied in various automation contexts where tasks need to be dynamically orchestrated and executed based on real-time inputs.
- Distributed Systems Management: Facilitates task management in distributed environments, supporting seamless communication and execution coordination.
